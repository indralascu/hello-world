# hello-world
This is my very first tutorial with GIT

Hello to everyone who is not reading this!

I love too many things to be good at anything, everything fascinates me, I'm like a retarded child that keeps picking up flowers where there are an infinite amount of them, always seeking the best one, and, of course, to perfect himself in the art of picking up.

THE END.
